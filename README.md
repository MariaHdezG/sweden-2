This website is used to promote three different areas in Sweden. I want to high=light three attractions and three hotels in these areas.

Stockholm  have a lot of attractions, and I have choosen the three most wanted of the tourists:
The City Hall that is beautiful design both outside and in the inside and where the Nobel Banquet is celebrated with the Royal family as hosts of the Nobel price winners and the relevant persons around those winners.

Drottningholm Palace, just outside Stockholm, and that is a Palace that wanted to be the Swedish version of Versille and that even haves its own theather inside. The park that is in front of the palace is huge and well mantained even nowdays and a must see for the visitors of Stockholm.

The Vasa Museum is for those interested in naval history since this warship sank right at it first journey 1628. It sank with all of its content and unfortunatly, also almost all the passangers in the ship since many of them could not swim and there was not prepared with much safetyness by thase times. Since the ship sank in the Baltic see, and the waters in that see is not that salty, the ship was well kept in those waters and it is one of the best reasons why this ship is so worth a visit. 

haves Grand Hotel because it is the most famous hotel of Stockholm, close to the Royal Palace, and just a short walk to the Old Town. Nobis Hotel for the beautiful indoor yard in the heart of the citys most exclusive shopping aerea, and Villa Dagmar because the outdoor backyard, and at a lively shopping and walking area where people meet at the cafeterias, restaurants, bars and outside meetingplaces.

The High Coast is the highest coastline in the world and it is a large area in the northeast of Sweden, in the province of Ã…ngemaland, and this area have been recognized by UNESCO for been a special area for the humankind to learn about what happened during and after the last ice-age and the evidences are visible in many places here at The High Coast. It is also such a wonderful area to experience the wild nature of the north, with forests, fjords, seacoast and Kvarken, an archipelag with a lot of small islets where the tourist can experience how intense birdlife can be if the nature can be left intact, but the tourist can also se the evidences of what the ice-age have done to this area.

Also included is a contact form and a map that shows markers for each attraction and hotels.

Promote the three regions to help boost tourism in the specific areas by highlighting the attractions located in each zone.
Who is this website for?
This website is used to promote three areas in Sweden. It is for people who are interested in Sweden as a holiday choice but might be unsure of which area to go to. Using this website they will have more information to help the tourist make a choice.
This website is for people based worldwide looking to travel for a holiday or extended stay, or may just want to access information for future references.
There are many good areas that a tourist can choose, but I decided to go deeper in those three different areas for holidays: Stockholm, The High Coast and Gotland.

Despite there are many places where children or teenagers can visit and enjoy, I had only considered what   could be interesting for grown-up here.

What does visitors expect? I tried to make the site easily to navigate, with a clear intention and purpose with responsivnes to different screensizes.

There is information about the areas, attractions and also about possible hotels or places to stay when visiting the areas and how to book through the indicated TripAdvisor page. 

There is also a form where it is possible to contact the editor of this site through an emailJS account but there is also possible to contact the administration of the page through the links to the different and relevant social media pages.
