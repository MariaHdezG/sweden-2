Manual Testing
Navigation Bar.
For my navigation bar, I tried to use a basic nav bar design but decided to go with a version from w3schools that used javascript to make the nav bar responsive. I edited the code to change the color of the background.
I had to change some of the % for the linear-gradient image as the white section was undetectable. Upon running the code again, I was happy with the result.
Welcome Image.
I used an image taken from Unsplash.com.
I found that the image was very large and I found it difficult to resize it on smaller screens, I tried to resize using media queries but this led to the image looking out of place. I changed to a different image from the same site. I found this image was very out of focus. I tried a third image that just looked too dark for the site and I felt gave it a moodier tone than I wanted. I select the image I have now. This image was brighter and brought a better atmosphere to the site. I tried to use the same code I used for the Stockholm, The High Coast and Gotland images but I found that with this image it cut the top of the image off. So I searched the internet and came up with a solution from geeks4geeks.com which helped me center the image and overlay text on top.
The contact button on the welcome image was blue. I wanted to change this to a light green to match the nav bar. It wouldn't responding at first but I found when I added "!important" to the code it changed to the desired color. I added the contact button in the welcome image as a quick way to navigate to the contact form at the bottom of the page.
Cards.
I used cards from w3schools and edited the look and content.
I added images taken from unsplash and links to the wikipedia pages for each tourist attraction and for tripadvisor for the hotels.
I found these to be responsive across all screen sizes.
Contact Form
Form was not sending when 'send message' button was pressed. I tried a few different ways of fixing this but ultimately I consulted tutor support who pointed me in the direction of my acc on emailJS. I realsied that the content I was trying to send did not match the content that the emailJS account was set up to recieve. ( Hello {{to_name}},
You got a new message from {{from_first}} {{from_last}} who can be contacted at email: {{from_email}},

phone number: {{from_number}}:

{{from_message}}

Best wishes, EmailJS team )

I realised I was trying to send {{ from_email_address }} instead of {{ from_email }}, I also hadnt set up the emailJS template to collect phone number information.

Once these were resolved I sent a new message and checked my inbox and the email was there with the correct information.

Back to top button.
Added as a means to navigate throught the site quickly. Taken from w3schools and edited to suit the color, size etc that I wanted. Found to be effective.
Easy Site Navigation
Throughout the site I have added features to make navigation through the site quick and easy.
'Contact us' button in the hero image that links to the contact form.
Back to top button that links to the top of the site.
'Go to map' link in each div that will link to the map. In future versions I would like this to be a Javascript button that will connect to and open the relevant infoWindow using an onclick event.
'Click here for more info' button on the infoWindows of the map linking to the appropiate information card.
Navigation back that will take you to the selected section when clicked.
'View on map' feature in the cards links to the relevant marker on the map. I want to make this more interactive in the future.

I believe that the site does build more awareness around these areas with potential to build an even large site using more areas in Sweden, Europe and beyond.
I believe it does showcase the attractions and hotels using cards with info, a map with infoWindows and links to relevant sites for more info and booking.
Links are in working order and go to relevant pages so the user can easily book which may encourage the user to return for more information and to book through this site.
Social media links are all active and would help to promote the site.

Warning for about section lacks heading. As this section only contains an image and a short paragraph, a heading is not necessary.
